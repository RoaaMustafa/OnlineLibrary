       <div> <h3>Computer Science</h3> </div>
        <p>Computer science is a major for problem solvers who want to learn how to use computers and computational processes to build websites, program robots, 
            mine data and more. Computer science majors may go on to master’s or doctorate programs in the field, 
            and they can work in research and industry. Students will gain experience with the theory and practice of computer science as they explore algorithms, programming languages and operating systems, 
            for example. In classes, majors may apply their learning to topics like computational finance, 
            robotics and network security. Undergraduates may also be able to access research opportunities. </p> </section>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p> Technological advances are a driving force for development. But policy choices determine who benefits.
             CGD focuses on three key questions around innovation, growth, and inequality: How can governments use existing technologies to deliver services 
             more effectively to citizens? How can international institutions help create and spread new technologies to tackle shared problems like climate change and pandemics? And how can policymakers ensure advances in artificial intelligence, automation,
             and communications bring shared benefits and not greater global inequality?</p> </section>
    <section class="space"> 
        <div><h3>Space</h3></div>
        <p> By studying the other planets in our own Solar System, we can try to place Earth in context. 
            ESA has already sent spacecraft to Earth’s nearest planetary neighbours – Mars and Venus – to understand why they evolved so differently, 
            and in the next decade we’ll be unlocking the secrets of the innermost planet, Mercury, too. The gas giants, and in particular Jupiter with its four large moons – some of which may harbour underground oceans – is also key to piece together the Solar System evolution. Unravelling the behaviour of our parent star, the Sun, is another crucial element to decipher our cosmic origins. And as more and more planets are found orbiting other stars, 
            understanding our own cosmic neighbourhood has never been so important.</p></section>
    <section class="engineering"> 
        <div><h3>Engineering </h3></div>
        <p> Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and find
             practical uses for scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance 
            the human condition, but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations available to the world.</p></section>
